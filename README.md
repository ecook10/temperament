# Piano Tuning Helper

a cross-platform app to guide piano tuning

also a place for me to try out some react-native / react-js cross breeding  

## Running
_assumes you have an android emulator ready to go_
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run start
$ npm run android
```

i assume that you can run `$ npm run ios` for iPhone, but i haven't tried yet

## Roadmap
- [X] draw piano
- [X] highlight pressed key
- [X] display key name
- [ ] octave scrolling
- [ ] model tuning steps + display them 
- [ ] build navigation 
- [ ] model reference intervals + display them 
- [ ] play reference clicks for each interval to illustrate the beat tempo to listen for 
- [ ] play reference sine waves to help identify the partials to tune against 

## Learning
- [X] read getting started w/ react-native tutorial
- [ ] refresh tuning theory

once everything is working, test cross-platform-ness + get working on web too
